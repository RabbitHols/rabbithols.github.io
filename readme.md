<b>Hello :)</b>

I'm Robert, a software engineer based in Rome.

Here are some of my projects:
- [coffepeertopeer](https://coffepeertopeer.robeert.com/) Developed a peer-to-peer chat system where users connect directly without a central server. Each peer receives a unique ID and can exchange messages with others, with automatic connection updates and message propagation. The system allows users to discover new peers by sharing their ID or querying a public tracker
- [AllYouCanEat](https://allyoucaneat.robeert.com) - Node ported as wasm module, Backend & Frontend on a static page.
- [Blazemark](https://blazemark.robeert.com) - Web-based markdown editor, The parse under the hood is done with md4c compiled as wasm module.
