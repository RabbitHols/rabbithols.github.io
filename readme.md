<b>Hello :)</b>

I'm Robert, a software engineer based in Rome.

Here are some of my projects:
- [pawndeck](https://pawndeck.robeert.com) **in Progress** - I am currently working on Pawndeck, a strategic game that blends chess mechanics with a unique card system. Each move demands careful planning, risk management, and the use of special abilities to outsmart an unpredictable opponent.
- [AllYouCanEat](https://allyoucaneat.robeert.com) - Node ported as wasm module, Backend & Frontend on a static page.
- [Blazemark](https://blazemark.robeert.com) - Web-based markdown editor, The parse under the hood is done with md4c compiled as wasm module.
